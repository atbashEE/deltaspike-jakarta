**Apache DeltaSpike** is a suite of portable CDI Extensions intended to make application development easier when working with CDI and Java EE.  

Contexts and Dependency Injection is a specification, published as:
* JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.0/html/
* JSR-346 (CDI-1.2) http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.2/cdi-spec.html
* JSR-365 (CDI-2.0) http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html

Apache DeltaSpike is compatible with all those specification versions.
Note that Apache DeltaSpike is **not** a CDI container itself, but a set of portable Extensions for it!


Some of the key features of Apache DeltaSpike include:

- A core module that supports component configuration, type safe messaging and internationalization, and exception handling.
- A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
- A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld, Apache OpenWebBeans and other CDI containers outside of a JavaEE server.
- JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
- JPA integration and transaction support.
- A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
- Scheduler integration

Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of your CDI enabled projects.

## Getting Started
